      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Our SME was founded with a mission to empower individuals who may not have had access to 
        formal education by equipping them with practical, marketable skills. We believe that skill 
        development is the key to unlocking opportunities, increasing employability, and fostering 
        entrepreneurship within our communities.</p>
    </section>

    <p>Through our tailored training programs, we enhance the capabilities of domestic workers and 
        gardeners, helping them become more valuable in the job market or thrive as independent service 
        providers. By investing in people, we aim to create a ripple effect of empowerment, confidence, 
        and economic growth in the communities we serve.</p>
